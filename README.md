# OpenCV-01
I have learnt and ran the examples given on http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html#gsc.tab=0

I am recent graduate from Columbia University. 
I made attempts to learn OpenCV. 

This repository contains multiple examples.

The file names are explained as, for eg: Core-Airth1.py means on OpenCV Python Tutorials webpage(http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html#gsc.tab=0) when you go to Core Operations => Arithmetic Operations on Images => first example given on that page(http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d0/d86/tutorial_py_image_arithmetics.html#gsc.tab=0)
